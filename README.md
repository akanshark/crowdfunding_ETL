# crowdfunding_ETL

This repository is based on the ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. The second step after extraction is to transform the data, by creating four CSV files and using the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, this data is uploaded into the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

## The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Create the Campaign DataFrame
Create the Contacts DataFrame
Create the Crowdfunding Database
